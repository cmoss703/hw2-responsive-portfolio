                    Hi there, I'm Christina. I'm a Full Stack web developer with a background in fire protection
                    engineering and building life safety codes. I recently earned a certificate in full stack web
                    development from the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp, with newly developed skills in
                    JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. With an engineering consulting and design
                    background, I am proficient in developing creative solutions to complex problems, have experience
                    meeting short deadlines with efficiency, and collaborating with team members to maintain the overall
                    vision of the project at hand. With each project, my aim is to develop a user friendly and
                    efficient, responsive design that makes the userâ€™s life easier in any way possible.
                    <br> <br>
                    I grew up in a small Kansas town, graduated with a degree in Architectural Engineering from the
                    University of Kansas, and moved to Kansas City, MO where I currently work as a Fire Protection
                    Engineer and Building Life Safety Code Consultant. Fire Protection can be pretty interesting at
                    times. I create fire and smoke simulations that show where the toxic chemicals build up, which then
                    allows me to build an effective smoke control system to remove the smoke so occupants can exit
                    safely. That's the fun part of my job. The other part, which is what most of my days consist of, is
                    largely reviewing building codes and drawings to ensure the building meets these laws. While I enjoy
                    my work life and atmosphere, I've been feeling rather stagnant in my career. I feel that software
                    development is more up my alley, and would be more stimulating to me personally.
                    <br><br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and activities. Some of these things include playing
                    board games, watching movies/TV, making stained glass art, candlemaking, doing various arts and
                    crafts, roller blading, cooking, playing Dungeons
                    and Dragons, having virtual game night with my friends, dancing, putting together outfits and makeup
                    looks, going out for a drink (when there
                    isn't a pandemic), taking my dog for a walk, moving furniture around
                    my house, and learning more and more about coding, of course!
                </p>
